# q
In the image below, you are attempting to use the Join tool to remove the overlapping portions of two paths (highlighted in yellow), but nothing seems to be happening. Why is this?
# a
The paths do not have a fill attribute.
# b
Only one of the paths is selected, but both need to be selected.
# c
One of the paths is selected but the Join tool works only with unselected paths.
# d
Endpoints need to be selected in both paths before they can be trimmed and joined.
