You have just one object on your artboard. You want to change its fill color from black to yellow, so you open the Color Picker and select a yellow color. But when you click OK, the fill of the object changes to gray, not yellow. Why is this happening?
# a
The color mode of the fill is set to Grayscale.
# b
The Luminosity blend mode is applied to the fill.
# c
One of the Color Blindness options is chosen under Proof Setup in the View menu.
# d
Overprint Preview is turned on in the Separations Preview panel.
